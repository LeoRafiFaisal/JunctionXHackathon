Application GUI files has been uploaded.

Facia_Landmark_DLIB.ipynb has been uploaded.

I have uploaded the results of all three models we used. 

We tried different approaches like zooming-in/out, mobile camera moving infront of face and others to 
check robustness of model and trick deepfake generation models.
